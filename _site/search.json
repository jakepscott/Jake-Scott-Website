I currently work as a Community\r\n            Development Analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of New\r\n            York. Here, I contribute to research/analytic projects on\r\n            topics such as financing climate adaptation in the housing\r\n            sector, building population health financing models, and\r\n            ensuring widespread household financing well-being. I do so\r\n            by working on every stage of the research and data analysis\r\n            process; from building reliable and reusable data pipelines,\r\n            to visualizing and analyzing complex data sets, to working\r\n            with domain experts. I also conduct outreach and organize\r\n            events that bring together policymakers, investors,\r\n            advocates, and other stakeholders.\r\n            I graduated in 2020 from Colgate University, where I\r\n            studied economics and political science. It is there that I\r\n            first fell in love with data science in general and with R\r\n            in particular. Since then, I have done countless academic,\r\n            professional, and personal projects using R, R Markdown, R\r\n            Shiny, and amazing packages like {tidyverse}, {tidytext},\r\n            {ggplot}, and more.\r\n            Prior to my current position, I worked as a Senior\r\n            Research Assistant for the Monetary\r\n            Studies Section of the Federal Reserve Board, a research\r\n            intern at the Hamilton Project at\r\n            the Brookings Institution, as a data research intern at\r\n            Burgiss, and as a\r\n            data intern at the Data\r\n            Collaboratory. I have also done work raising money as a\r\n            student caller, doing research as a research assistant and\r\n            coauthor, knocking on doors as a political canvasser, and\r\n            teaching students as an economics tutor. The throughline for\r\n            all of this work, as well as my personal projects, is a deep\r\n            interest in using data to understand and impact the world,\r\n            particularly in the realm of public policy and the\r\n            economy.\r\n            Outside of work and data, I enjoy reading, watching the\r\n            Giants, Mets, and Sixers, and exploring NYC (run clubs,\r\n            skeeball, board game cafes, and more). Please feel free to\r\n            reach out if you have any questions about my work, if you\r\n            think I could help your team, or if you just want to chat\r\n            about R or anything else!\r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n            \r\n              Jake Scott\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      LinkedIn\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      Twitter\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      GitHub\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      Email\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                  \r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Welcome to my personal website!
