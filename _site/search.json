I currently work as a Senior Research Assistant for the Monetary Studies Section of the Federal Reserve Board, where I contribute to every stage of the research and data analysis process; from building reliable and reusable data pipelines, to visualizing and analyzing complex data sets, to building, running, and maintaining econometric models.\r\n            I graduated in 2020 from Colgate University, where I studied economics and political science. It is there that I first fell in love with data science in general and with R in particular. Since then, I have done countless academic, work, and personal projects using R, R Markdown, R Shiny, and amazing packages like {tidyverse}, {tidytext}, {ggplot}, and more.\r\n            Prior to my current position, I worked as a research intern at the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution, as a data research intern at Burgiss, and as a data intern at the Data Collaboratory. I have also done work raising money as a student caller, doing research as a research assistant and then as a coauthor with a professor, knocking on doors as a political canvasser, and teaching students as a economics tutor. The through line of all of this work, as well as my personal projects, is a deep interest in using data to understand the world and to communicate with others, particularly in the realm of public policy and the economy. I also just really like taking unique and messy data, cleaning it, and generating pretty visualizations that at least one other person will look at and think “neat”.\r\n            Outside of work and data, I enjoy reading (sci fi and non-fiction are my one two punch these days- Zones of Thought series anyone?), getting my heartbroken by the Giants, Mets, and Sixers, and going fishing (freshwater only, the ocean is too scary). Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions about my work, if you think I could help your team, or if you just want to chat about R or anything else!\r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n            \r\n              Jake Scott\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      LinkedIn\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      Twitter\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      GitHub\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                    \r\n                    \r\n                      Email\r\n                    \r\n                  \r\n                                  \r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Welcome to my personal website!
