I currently work as a Community\r\n            Development Analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of New\r\n            York. Here, I combine original data analysis with insights\r\n            gathered from interviews, roundtables, and working groups\r\n            with experts and stakeholders to generate briefs, reports,\r\n            and whitepapers. These span topics ranging from the\r\n            electrification of affordable housing to the size\r\n            and growth of the community development financial\r\n            institution (CDFI) industry. I also conduct outreach and\r\n            organize events that bring together policymakers, investors,\r\n            advocates, and other stakeholders on topics such as\r\n            affordable service-enriched senior housing and employee\r\n            stock ownership plans.\r\n            Prior to my current position, I worked as a senior\r\n            research assistant for the Monetary\r\n            Studies Section of the Federal Reserve Board, a research\r\n            intern at the Hamilton Project at\r\n            Brookings, as a data research intern at Burgiss, and as a data\r\n            intern at the Colgate\r\n            Data Collaboratory. I have also published academic\r\n            research as a research assistant and coauthor, done work\r\n            raising money as a student caller, knocked on doors as a\r\n            political canvasser, and taught students as an economics\r\n            tutor. The through line for all of this work, as well as my\r\n            personal projects, is a deep interest in using data to\r\n            understand and impact the world, particularly in the realm\r\n            of public policy, urban planning, and the economy.\r\n            I am a proud member of the Colgate University class of\r\n            2020, where I studied economics and political science.\r\n            Outside of work, I enjoy reading, watching the Giants,\r\n            Mets, and Sixers, and exploring NYC.
