Welcome to my personal website! I currently work as a [Community Development Analyst](https://www.newyorkfed.org/outreach-and-education/staff) at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Here, I combine original data analysis with insights gathered from interviews, roundtables, and working groups with experts and stakeholders to generate briefs, reports, and whitepapers. These span topics ranging from [the electrification of affordable housing](https://www.newyorkfed.org/outreach-and-education/climate/fed-affordable-housing-and-energy-transition) to the [size and growth of the community development financial institution industry](https://www.newyorkfed.org/outreach-and-education/household-financial-stability/sizing-the-cdfi-market-understanding-industry-growth). I also conduct outreach and organize events that bring together policymakers, investors, advocates, and other stakeholders on topics such as affordable service-enriched senior housing and employee stock ownership plans. 


Prior to my current position, I worked as a senior research assistant for the [Monetary Studies Section](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/mams-staff.htm) of the Federal Reserve Board, a research intern at the [Hamilton Project at Brookings](https://www.hamiltonproject.org/), as a data research intern at [Burgiss](https://www.burgiss.com/), and as a data intern at the [Colgate Data Collaboratory](https://www.colgate.edu/about/campus-services-and-resources/data-science-collaboratory). I have also published academic research as a research assistant and coauthor, done work raising money as a student caller, knocked on doors as a political canvasser, and taught students as an economics tutor. The through line for all of this work, as well as my personal projects, is a deep interest in using data to understand and impact the world, particularly in the realm of public policy, urban planning, and the economy. 

I am a proud member of the Colgate University class of 2020, where I studied economics and political science.

Outside of work, I enjoy reading, watching the Giants, Mets, and Sixers, and exploring NYC. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions about my work or if you just want to chat about R or anything else!
