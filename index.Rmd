Welcome to my personal website! I currently work as a [Community Development Analyst](https://www.newyorkfed.org/outreach-and-education/staff) at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Here, I contribute to research/analytic projects on topics such as financing climate adaptation in the housing sector, building population health financing models, and ensuring widespread household financing well-being. I do so by working on every stage of the research and data analysis process; from building reliable and reusable data pipelines, to visualizing and analyzing complex data sets, to working with domain experts. I also conduct outreach and organize events that bring together policymakers, investors, advocates, and other stakeholders. 

I graduated in 2020 from Colgate University, where I studied economics and political science. It is there that I first fell in love with data science in general and with R in particular. Since then, I have done countless academic, professional, and personal projects using R, R Markdown, R Shiny, and amazing packages like {tidyverse}, {tidytext}, {ggplot}, and more. 

Prior to my current position, I worked as a Senior Research Assistant for the [Monetary Studies Section](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/mams-staff.htm) of the Federal Reserve Board, a research intern at the [Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution](https://www.hamiltonproject.org/), as a data research intern at [Burgiss](https://www.burgiss.com/), and as a data intern at the [Data Collaboratory](https://www.colgate.edu/about/campus-services-and-resources/data-science-collaboratory). I have also done work raising money as a student caller, doing research as a research assistant and coauthor, knocking on doors as a political canvasser, and teaching students as an economics tutor. The throughline for all of this work, as well as my personal projects, is a deep interest in using data to understand and impact the world, particularly in the realm of public policy and the economy. 

Outside of work and data, I enjoy reading, watching the Giants, Mets, and Sixers, and exploring NYC (run clubs, skeeball, board game cafes, and more). Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions about my work, if you think I could help your team, or if you just want to chat about R or anything else!
